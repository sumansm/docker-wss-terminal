# docker-wss-terminal
This service provides real-time, interactive shell access to Docker containers over WebSocket Secure (WSS) using a simple and secure API. It generates short-lived JWT tokens, validates access, and opens a fully interactive /bin/bash or /bin/sh terminal session inside a running Docker container.
